I've chosen this code chunk as an exemplary representation of my coding proficiency because it closely mirrors the table created by Pickering and Davis in one of their studies, which evaluated people's proximity to water sources. The code generates a table that groups observations by country, displaying the count of observations, the year, the mean, the standard deviation, the median, and the percentage of individuals with water access on their land. Additionally, the table includes a row at the bottom listing the total sum of each column, excluding the country column. This code exemplifies my ability to identify the necessary summary statistics required to accurately replicate the table's format, as well as my skill in renaming the dataset's variables. Furthermore, it showcases my capability to replicate stylistic elements present in the table, achieved through precise formatting of the column headers using the kable package.

Furthermore, this code illustrates my capacity to comprehend the data's underlying meaning and use this understanding to generate new variables. For instance, in replicating the variable "% on plot" as seen in Pickering and Davis' table, I recognized the need to determine the number of individuals for whom the 'waterTimeMins'—representing the walk time from their home to a water source—was zero minutes.I then calculated the '% on plot" this percentage by dividing the aforementioned count by the total number of individuals per country.
